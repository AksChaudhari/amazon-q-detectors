## Amazon Q Detector Examples

Amazon Q is an AWS service that uses program analysis and machine learning to detect potential defects that are difficult for developers to find and offers suggestions for improvement.
For more information about how to set up and use Q, see the [Amazon Q User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/).

This repo demonstrates some of Q's supported languages detectors. For more descriptions of each detector, see our [Detector Library](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/detector-library/index.html).

PLEASE NOTE: This repo is for demonstration purpose only. It is meant to educate people about 'security flaws'. The code examples contain vulnerable code and should not be used for real-word purposes.
